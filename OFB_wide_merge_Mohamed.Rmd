## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
Mohamed_Data <- read_csv("Mohamed_Data.csv")

OFB_wide <- read_delim("OFB_wide.csv", delim = ";", 
    escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

#glimpse(Mohamed_Data)
```

```{r}

Mohamed_Data |> 
  select(id, food_security_score, 
food_security_status,
food_security_status_description) -> Food_Security

glimpse(Food_Security)

Food_Security <- mutate(Food_Security, id=as.integer(substring(id,3,8)))
OFB_wide <- mutate(OFB_wide, id=as.integer(id))

```



```{r}
#glimpse(OFB_wide)
OFB_wide <- left_join(OFB_wide, Food_Security, by="id")
```

### Change FSC=food_security_score and FS_Status = food_security_status

```{r}
OFB_wide <- OFB_wide |>
mutate(FSC = food_security_score,
       FS_Status = food_security_status) |>
select(-food_security_status, -food_security_score)
```


### Write to csv file - if needed

```{r}
write_csv2(OFB_wide, "OFB_wide.csv") 

```
