```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r}
questions <- c("q001"="Language of survey",
               "q002"="Is your income enough to meet your food needs?",
               "q003"= "How often did the following occur in the last 12 months",
               "q012"="Which food bank do you visit the most often?"
)

questions["q012"]






```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
